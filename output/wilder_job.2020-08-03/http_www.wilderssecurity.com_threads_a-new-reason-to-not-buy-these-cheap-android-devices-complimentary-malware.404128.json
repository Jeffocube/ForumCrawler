Users in more than 90 countries, including the US, are said to be infected. The good news is there&#8217;s a fix.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the <a href=\"https://blog.avast.com/android-devices-ship-with-pre-installed-malware\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"externalLink\">report</a>, this adware variant has been in the wild for three years. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Cosiloon&#8221; and was first noticed by <a href=\"https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=10345&amp;lng=en\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"externalLink\">Dr. Web</a> in 2016. Because it&#8217;s located in the device&#8217;s firmware, it&#8217;s extremely difficult to remove. Avast has detected its presence on 18,000 of its users&#8217; devices, so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nCosiloon has evolved and been updated over the years while largely using the same methods. In one variant, an application is located on the /system partition that downloads a manifest of instructions for which services to start and further downloads. A payload is then installed that serves pop-up ads that your twitchy fingers will likely click inadvertently and could lead to other security issues.<br/>\nAt this point, the researchers have listed 142 devices that are affected but not every unit of a specific model will be a problem because of variants in firmware.</div><div class=\"quoteExpand\">Click to expand...</div></blockquote>\n\t</aside>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"messageTextEndMarker\">&#160;</div>\n\t\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</article>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t"], "timestamp": 1596487834.799652, "user_time_joined": ["Oct 27, 2012"], "user_title": ["Updates Team"]}, {"username": ["roger_m"], "post_number": ["2"], "uid": ["92859"], "user_posts": ["7,515"], "post_date_last_edited": null, "user_location": null, "pid": ["2758865"], "post_date": ["May 24, 2018"], "post_content": ["<div class=\"messageContent\">\t\t\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<blockquote class=\"messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere's no malware, on my cheap, Chinese smartphone and tablet.\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"messageTextEndMarker\">&#160;</div>\n\t\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</article>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t"], "timestamp": 1596487834.799652, "user_time_joined": ["Jan 25, 2009"], "user_title": ["Registered Member"]}, {"username": ["shmu26"], "post_number": ["3"], "uid": ["146836"], "user_posts": ["1,440"], "post_date_last_edited": null, "user_location": null, "pid": ["2758896"], "post_date": ["May 25, 2018"], "post_content": ["<div class=\"messageContent\">\t\t\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<blockquote class=\"messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat about Xaiomi?
