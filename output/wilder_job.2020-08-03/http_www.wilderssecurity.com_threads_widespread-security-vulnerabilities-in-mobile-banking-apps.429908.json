The analysis found that mobile banking applications have a raft of security flaws which can be exploited by cyber-criminals to access sensitive data and commit fraud.<br/>\n<br/>\nPositive Technologies said that none of the 14 mobile banking applications tested had an acceptable level of security. In regard to the applications installed by clients, 43% were shown to store important information on the phone in clear text, making the data at risk of being accessed by an unauthorized party. In addition, 76% of the vulnerabilities can be exploited without physical access to the device and over one-third can be exploited without administrator rights.</div><div class=\"quoteExpand\">Click to expand...</div></blockquote>\n\t</aside>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeQuote\">\n\t<aside>\n\t\t\n\t\t<blockquote class=\"quoteContainer\"><div class=\"quote\">There were also variations in the types of security flaws between iOS and android apps; in iOS, no flaws were rated above &#8216;medium,&#8217; whereas in android, 29% were &#8216;high risk.&#8217;</div><div class=\"quoteExpand\">Click to expand...</div></blockquote>\n\t</aside>\n</div><a href=\"https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/about/news/half-of-mobile-banks-are-vulnerable-to-theft-of-funds-through-mobile-app-flaws/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"externalLink\">Positive Technologies: Half of mobile banks are vulnerable to theft of funds through mobile app flaws</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"messageTextEndMarker\">&#160;</div>\n\t\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</article>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t"], "timestamp": 1596487970.841908, "user_time_joined": ["Oct 27, 2012"], "user_title": ["Updates Team"]}]
