The activity continued in spite of proper safety protocols including changing an account holder's number, resetting an associated Apple ID and remotely wiping a stolen handset using iCloud security tools. Those early accounts were the first to document a more serious problem.</div><div class=\"quoteExpand\">Click to expand...</div></blockquote>\n\t</aside>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeQuote\">\n\t<aside>\n\t\t\n\t\t<blockquote class=\"quoteContainer\"><div class=\"quote\">As described in the filing, Ohanian purchased an iPhone 6s while on vacation in New York. He activated the device on T-Mobile's network and used it for about one year. T-Mobile later recycled Ohanian's number for use by Lopez, who was assigned the number when he switched carriers. Ohanian, who had since removed the T-Mobile SIM from his iPhone 6s, began to receive \"extensive amounts\" of unwanted communications addressed to Lopez. These messages included private photos and other correspondence.<br/>\n<br/>\nApple failed to remedy the problem when contacted, and the company failed to address the larger \"pervasive data security breach\" publicly. T-Mobile is on the hook for engaging in \"deceptive\" SIM card practices, the suit alleges.</div><div class=\"quoteExpand\">Click to expand...</div></blockquote>\n\t</aside>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"messageTextEndMarker\">&#160;</div>\n\t\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</article>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t"], "timestamp": 1596487865.727922, "user_time_joined": ["Oct 27, 2012"], "user_title": ["Updates Team"]}]
