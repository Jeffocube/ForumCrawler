Developers insert Ad SDKs into their apps&#8217; code to gain revenue through ads. Thus, they can offer their apps for free and still make money. Most variants of BatMobi were clean and safe to use&#8212;until recently.<br/>\n<b><span style=\"color: #0000b3\">The scary reality of Ad SDKs</span></b><br/>\nTechnically, since these hidden BatMobi variants no longer trigger ads inappropriately, they are no longer considered adware.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis all leaves us with an uneasy feeling about Ad SDKs. It highlights their power to switch from clean and safe to adware overnight. It&#8217;s a scary reality to have code lay dormant in legitimate apps that can turn malicious so quickly.<br/>\nUnfortunately, finding an Ad SDK that developers can trust is an ongoing challenge. All we can say is do your research and choose wisely. If an Ad SDK has any variants that are considered adware, as with BatMobi, it&#8217;s a wise decision to stay clear.</div><div class=\"quoteExpand\">Click to expand...</div></blockquote>\n\t</aside>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"messageTextEndMarker\">&#160;</div>\n\t\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</article>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t"], "timestamp": 1596488001.753391, "user_time_joined": ["Oct 27, 2012"], "user_title": ["Updates Team"]}, {"username": ["mood"], "post_number": ["4"], "uid": ["130753"], "user_posts": ["30,160"], "post_date_last_edited": null, "user_location": null, "pid": ["2821546"], "post_date": ["Apr 18, 2019"], "post_content": ["<div class=\"messageContent\">\t\t\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<blockquote class=\"messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<b><span style=\"color: #0000b3\">Google pulls popular Chinese Android apps over large-scale ad fraud</span></b><br/>\n<i><span style=\"color: #0000b3\">They include the popular Selfie Camera app</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #808080\">April 17, 2019</span></i><br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/18/google-pulls-android-apps-ad-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"externalLink\">https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/18/google-pulls-android-apps-ad-fraud/</a><br/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeQuote\">\n\t<aside>\n\t\t\n\t\t<blockquote class=\"quoteContainer\"><div class=\"quote\">Google pulled a number of popular Android apps from the Play Store after <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/google-play-store-ad-fraud-du-group-baidu\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"externalLink\"><i>BuzzFeed News</i></a> has discovered a large-scale ad fraud scheme their developers were pulling off.
