These apps have since been removed from the store, but we recently found a variant of this family that had made its way onto Google Play via five malicious apps, although these have also been removed. (We detect these as AndroidOS_Tekya.HRX.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis variant of Tekya shares many similarities with the previously found version. For example, the encryption remains essentially identical. The same algorithms and keys are used in both versions.<br/>\nAccording to its code, Tekya would target up to 11 advertising networks, including: Admob, Facebook, and Unity. Advertisements from these networks would be displayed, and user touch events imitated through InputManager.</div><div class=\"quoteExpand\">Click to expand...</div></blockquote>\n\t</aside>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeQuote\">\n\t<aside>\n\t\t\n\t\t<blockquote class=\"quoteContainer\"><div class=\"quote\">We originally found several of these apps on Google Play, but Google removed these from the App Store while our research was underway.
