their credentials and take over their banking accounts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe alert, published on the agency's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), says that the increased usage of such apps during the pandemic could lead to more exploitation attempts targeting their users.<br/>\nThe FBI is anticipating that threat actors will focus their attacks on mobile banking customers since most Americans are using such services for making payments, transferring funds, and cashing checks.<br/>\n<div style=\"padding-left: 30px\">\"US financial technology providers estimate more than 75 percent of Americans
